# Irrational Approximations
*Read more about this project on https://wonik.info/projects/irrational-approximator*


This is a simple frontend web app using no external libraries or modules which implements an algorithm written by us to generate rational approximations of irrational numbers. This web app allows the user to run the algorithm in their browser with their own parameters. This algorithm was made by us at Wonik and was implemented and Javascript mainly for user support. You are able to read up on the inspirations behind this algorithm and how it works on the link we've attached above.

# Usage

You can implement this algorithm wherever you want using any language, we don't need credit for this as it was made for the people. However, if you want to run this web app in your browser then visit https://wonik.tech/simulator/irrational-approx

If you came here just to see the implementation of the algorithm, it is located at [approximator.js](https://github.com/Wonik-Studios/irrational-approximations/blob/main/approximator.js)
