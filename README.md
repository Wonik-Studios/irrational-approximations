This is a simple frontend web app using no external libraries or modules which implements an algorithm written by us to generate rational approximations of irrational numbers. This web app allows the user to run the algorithm in their browser with their own parameters. This algorithm was made by us at Wonik and was implemented and Javascript mainly for user support. You are able to read up on the inspirations behind this algorithm and how it works on the link we've attached above.
